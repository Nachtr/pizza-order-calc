Firstly we need to define the problem:
The Problem: Calculate the total cost of the pizza order based on the follow factors:
- Pizza Size (Small or Large)
- Number of toppings
- Delivery distance

Therefor our inputs are:
- User indicates through input command the size of pizza (small or large) # Consider using a dict to make numbers easier to calculate.
- User enters the number of toppings.
- User enters the total mileage to their home

Outputs:
- We need to print the total cost using an f-string.
  - Maybe something like print(f"The total for the {size} pizza is {price}
    - This is not exactly how it wil be displayed, but it will probably be something close to this.



Secondly, lets outline a possible solution:
1. We first need to prompt the user for inputs on:
  - Pizza Size
  - Number of toppings
  - Total distance for delivery in Miles
2. We then need to build an algorithm/function for calculating the base cost:
  1. Base cost of the pizza:
    - A small pizza is $8
    - A large pizza is $12
  2. Topping costs:
    - each additional topping is $1
  3. Delivery Fees
    - $2 for the first 5 miles
    - $1 for each additional mile
3. Computing the total cost:
  - We need to find the base cost, toppings cost, and delivery fee and then sum it up.
4. Output/print the final price.

Next, we need to define key or critical variables and data structures that will be used in our pseudocode.
- pizza_size (string?)
- num_toppings (integer and not float)
- delivery_distance (float)
- base_price (float) #  indicates the price of the pizza
- topping_cost (float)
- delivery_fee (float) # for this we should use operators, and maybe a few smaller variables to define the total distance
- total_cost (float) # Sum of all of it

Pseudocode:
//Step 1: Total pizza cost
print("enter pizza size (small or large): ")
input(pizza_size) # will trigger the user to enter the size
# convert the string to lower case for easy use

# make the fail safe for if the user says anything else besides small or large.
while pizza_size is not in ["small", "large"]
  print("Invalid Input. Please refer to "small" or "large"")
  input("enter pizza size (small or large)")
  conver the string to lower case

# toppings
print("enter number of toppings: ")
input(num_toppings)

# toppings fail safe
while num_toppings is not an integer < 0
  print("Invalid input. Please enter a number that is non-negative."
  input(num_toppings)
  convert to integer, or use some sort of ending code to convert.

# delivery distance
print("Enter delivery distance in miles: ")
input(delivery_distance)

# delivery fail safe to ensure no negative miles 
while delivery_distance is not a number or delivery_distance < 0
  print("Invalid input. Please enter a non-negative number.")
  convert the number to float since mileage might be with decimal

//Step 2: Define a dictionary for pizza prices to make it easier to calc
set pizza_prices = {
  "small": 8.00,
  "large": 10.00
}

//Step 3: Calculations for base price of pizza without toppings
set base_price = pizza_prices[pizza_size]

//Step 4: Calculate topping costs after base price
set topping_costs = num_toppings * 1

//Step 5: Calculate delivery fee per distance
If delivery_distance == 0 then
  set delivery_fee = 0
else if delivery_distance <= 5 then
  set delivery_fee = 2
else
  set delivery_fee = (delivery_distance - 5?) * 1 # I dont know if this will work but we will try it

//Step 6: Computing total cost
set total_cost = base_price + topping_cost + delivery_fee

//Step 7: Display final cost
print(f"Your total order cost for a {pizza_size} with {num_toppings} toppings and delivery distnace of {delivery_distance} miles is ${total_cost}
