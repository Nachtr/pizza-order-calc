# pizza-order-calc
This is an assigned project for my SMU Flatiron AI bootcamp. For more Information, please go through the README file!

Basic Scenario


You work for a pizza delivery company that needs a program to calculate order costs. The company has specific pricing rules:

    Pizza sizes and base prices:
        Small pizza: $8
        Large pizza: $12
        
    Toppings: $1 for each additional topping
    
    Delivery fee:
        $2 for the first 5 miles
        $1 for each additional mile

Your task: Create a Python script that prompts the user for order details, calculates the total cost, and displays the result.

Additionally this project should be done in multiple steps and include the psuedocode as well as the flow chart for the project. Please see attached files.
